# Redis Caching in Node JS

> Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. Redis enables you to write traditionally complex code with fewer, simpler lines. With Redis, you write fewer lines of code to store, access, and use data in your applications. The difference is that developers who use Redis can use a simple command structure as opposed to the query languages of traditional databases.

## Installation

First you need to install Redis to your machine. If you're using a mac, no issues just install Redis using your CLI. But for windows you need to install it manually. Refer this video, [install Redis on Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nFwPTHOMIY).

Then install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```js
1. npm install
2. npm start
```

and access the application at http://localhost:5000/
